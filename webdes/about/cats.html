  <h2 class="fixed">About Julie's Cats</h2>
  <p>
    While I would never say no to a pupper, I grew up with kitties during my childhood. At one point, my family had a combined total of fifteen cats. Here lies some information about a select few. </p>


  <h3>My Cats</h3>
  <p>
    Here is a chart describing the three cats in my immediate family.  </p>

  <h3>Some Photos</h3>

    Harley is this dapper guy in the tuxedo, who belonged to my aunt. He sadly passed away this winter at an impresive 19 years of age, but we had a wonderful birthday celebration complete with a tuna sandwich "cake" that even had a candle.

    Paulie is my beautiful burnt orange baby, and he's about 6 years old. We think that he is part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyssinian_cat" target="_blank" >Abyssinian</a>, but we can't be sure because he was rescued from Fort Tryon Park in <a href="../nyc/index.html">New York City</a>. </p>
