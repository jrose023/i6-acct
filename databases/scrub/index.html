          I selected this dataset because it offered a very complete view of naming choices in the US. I retrieved the data from data.gov, which links to this site on the the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/background.html">Social Security Website</a>, providing some background on the collection of this dataset. Looking at name data can offer an insight into the culture and influences on the United States over a given period of time, especially when analyzing a change over time in a certain name's popularity.

          In analyzing the data in a spreadsheet, I faced several difficulties in the sheer number of names and the great variation in their popularity, ranging from 50,000 people to 5 people. This made it somewhat difficult to graph given my lack of Excel expertise. To adjust for this, I only took names used 500 times or more to make it more usable. Some other changes I made were to remove names like "baby" or "unknown."
