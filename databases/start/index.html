              This article details the recent largescale personal information breach of Equifax, a credit reporting agency. In a recent email I received from my bank, they listed the following facts:
              <ul>
                <li>This impacted 143 million American consumers (The UK and Canada were also impacted)</li>
                <li>The breach lasted from mid-May through July of this year</li>
                <li>Hackers accessed people's names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver's license numbers</li>
                <li>Hackers also stole credit card numbers for about 209,000 people and dispute documents with personal identifying information for about 182,000 people</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of the articles on this topic were outraged op-ed pieces on the magnitude of the breach, the time elapsed between the breach and the news break, and lately the ways Equifax is attempting to remedy the situation. The biggest sentiment is a disdain for the "well, this is the world we live in now"-attitude with which this controversy has been met. At the same time, however, this is the world we live in. It is almost impossible to live in today's social, economic and political scape without throwing your information at companies everyday.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another point of rage comes from the fact that Equifax is offering free credit monitoring for the small price of your silence and loyalty&mdash;that you forfeit your ability to file a class action lawsuit against Equifax for losing your personal data. A <a href="https://siliconangle.com/blog/2017/09/11/equifax-consumer-credit-data-hack-deeply-concerns-security-researchers/">related article</a> points out the central issue at hand: "We have become overly reliant on the three credit bureaus that act as the sole data 'brokers' and repositories of data for creditworthiness, making an exposure like this a very dangerous event."
            </p>
            <p>
              Equifax has not released the exact details of the breach, stating its cause was a "website application vulnerability." So we don't know why this happened or how to fix it, but we do know that no one really cares about their personal information, and that companies that have these breaches face very few consequences. To me, I find it hard to demonize any one character in the narrative; the article also mentions that Equifax surely had many resources dedicated to cybersecurity, yet they still fell victim. Such is the story with Yahoo, Target, and so on. I find it hard to believe any of these companies were sitting idly by while burglars were sneaking in the back door.

              In the upcoming release of the new Apple toys this week, a big topic revolves around the facial recognition feature said to perhaps replace the fingerprint sensor. My first thought on that is "absolutely no." I use Facebook and Google Photos religiously, which both have sophisticated facial recognition software, and they both get it wrong ALL the time. Even if there is some second level of validation like a facial expression, I am still skeptical. To use this sort of biometric data seems extremely sloppy and difficult to make secure. Things like passwords and even fingerprints are more concrete in nature and almost impossible to replicate. After briefly reading up on the subject, my opinion is roughly the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              This article I appreciated in that it contained only testimonies from experts in the subjects of computer science and privacy law. Regarding the databases which would contain this information, a professor of law and computer science wrote, "will the faceprints be stored locally and can authentication occur without having to access a remote location using the Internet? Or will they be stored in a centralized database? If so, what are the technical, administrative, and physical safeguards for those databases?"
            </p>
            <p>
              Having a face associated with personal information poses a danger to personal safety and privacy in several realms. A different lawyer explains the scenario in which a retail store might use a big collection of facial recognition data to learn about their customers, which leads to a rabbit hole of unwanted surveillance. But then again, aren't <em>they</em> already surveilling us? I am constantly in a tug of war on the issue of whether we (or I) even really care about the data being collected about us. Does the trade off of getting a cute Google Photos video about my baby cousin from age 1 to 7&mdash;entitled "They Grow Up So Fast"&mdash;make up for the fact that there is now data in the cloud about a small child who otherwise doesn't "exist" in terms of data collection? And what does the Big Bad Company do with the detailed GPS information they collected on my phone? I don't know, but it sure makes my life a hell of a lot easier to know whether the A train is going to ruin my life today.

              The central concern of this article is asking the question: "are we controlling our data or is it controlling us?" If offers a nearly exhaustive analysis of the dangers of big data and its collection in our world, warning that "if we [as a society] take the wrong decisions it could threaten our greatest historical achievements," recognizing the double-edged sword of the topic. In the words of George Orwell: "who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past." A quote from an author of this article reads: he who has large amounts of data can manipulate people in subtle ways. But even benevolent decision-makers may do more wrong than right," says Dirk Helbing.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I found particularly valuable about the article was its eagerness to solve the problem, offering many ideas of how to better shape the legislature, public opinion/understanding, and technical practices involved in big data collection. This was a 20+ page article, so here I've compiled some quotes that I found thought-provoking from a re-read of the first half.
            </p>
            <p id = "quote">
              "According to recent reports, every Chinese citizen will receive a so-called "Citizen Score", which will determine under what conditions they may get loans, jobs, or travel visa to other countries . . . Everything they do gives plus or minus points. This is not only aimed at mass surveillance. The score depends on an individual's clicks on the Internet and their politically-correct conduct or not, and it determines their credit terms, their access to certain jobs, and travel visas. Therefore, the Citizen Score is about behavioural and social control. Even the behaviour of friends and acquaintances affects this score."
            </p>
            <p>
              If you've watched this episode of Black Mirror, you're already mortified reading this paragraph. This is an extremely plausible future. Today we already define social relationships in terms of our networking past and abilities; who's to say there won't be a political version eventually? That is, after all, the basis of things like credit scores and income brackets. The large amount of data collection is already being used to influence what we see on our neighorhoods and our Facebook feeds, and to imagine a world where the ease of access to personal data is used to prevent individuals from participating in certain institutions or activities is not a far reach.

              "The legality of personalized pricing is questionable, because it could be a misuse of insider information. Other relevant aspects are possible breaches of the principles of equality and non-discrimination&mdash;and of competition laws, as free market access and price transparency are no longer guaranteed. The situation is comparable to businesses that sell their products cheaper in other countries, but try to prevent purchases via these countries. Such cases have resulted in high punitive fines in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similar to the China "Citizen Score" idea. I regularly see anti-smoking commercials that reference the fact Big Tobacco gives more attention to predominantly Black and Latinx communities. It is also a fact that in many areas of the country there exist "food deserts," where it is nearly impossible to purchase fresh fruits, vegetables and other foods, and that that is directly correlated to impoverished neighborhoods. We live in a capitalist society, which is often times used to excuse these deeds. But to personalize the goods a consumer purchases seems like a malpractice of data collection and an exploitation of the individual.
            </p>
            <p>
              The basis of "personalized pricing" is based in the concept of what this article calls "Big Nudging." This refers to the use of data to influence consumers, voters, and the public. This is an extremely common and noticeable trend in our digital lives, you google what day the eclipse is going to happen, and when you scroll through your Facebook later, you see ads for eclipse glasses. The article reads: "often the recommendations we are offered fit so well that the resulting decisions feel as if they were our own, even though they are actually not our decisions."
            </p>
            <p>
              The repercussions of this "nudging" is a focus of much of the article. They give an example of health insurance providers giving out fitness bracelets to reduce heart disease, which might in turn lead to more hip operations in the end. Improvement in one area leads to deterioration in another, which begs the question of what is really here to help us. What makes an idea or technology <em>good</em> or <em>successful</em>? Longevity? Revenue? Popularity?
            </p>
            <p>
              In a similar vein, the article discusses that there are more and more jobs being lost to "algorithms," in that data is more valuable and foolproof than human interpretation of public opinion. So what happens to humans then? It is later discussed the concept of Artificial Intelligence becoming more powerful and useful than humans themselves.

              "The idea of replacing the thinking of all citizens by a computer cluster would be absurd, because that would dramatically lower the diversity and quality of the solutions achievable. It is already clear that the problems of the world have not decreased despite the recent flood of data and the use of personalized information&mdash;on the contrary! World peace is fragile. The long-term change in the climate could lead to the greatest loss of species since the extinction of dinosaurs. We are also far from having overcome the financial crisis and its impact on the economy. Cyber-crime is estimated to cause an annual loss of 3 trillion dollars. States and terrorists are preparing for cyberwarfare."
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem with all this is that, yes, we recognize the uncontrollable things happening. "Almost all companies and institutions have already been hacked, even the Pentagon, the White House, and the NSA," the article reads, but no one cares. "Nevertheless, our freedom is disappearing slowly, but surely&mdash;in fact, slowly enough that there has been little resistance from the population, so far." We are all terrified of the robot revolution, but there is very little for the individual to <em>do</em> about it. What, you want me to get a flip phone when this new iPhone is so shiny?? No way. Our culture demands more convenience and ease of access to information, and to put restrictions on it seems counterproductive. But the article recognizes the duality of the matter:
            </p>
            <p id="quote">
              "Personalized information builds a "filter bubble" around us, a kind of digital prison for our thinking . . . Collective intelligence requires a high degree of diversity. This is, however, being reduced by today's personalized information systems, which reinforce trends."
            </p>
            <p>
              The article further discusses the possible remedies to the problems outlined. What I found most interesting was the discussion of creating new "social contract." Data "bubbles"&mdash;i.e., everyone on my Facebook and in my dorm hates Donald Trump, there's no WAY he'll get elected!&mdash;promote homogeny, which is self-serving and destroys productivity in any social group, from a workplace to a country. Sure, we spent a few thousand years philosophizing about how to best inhabit the same dirt, but now there's the internet, which has radically changed human interaction and relationships. They more practically suggest ways in which the current political systems can enforce new best practices for information control.

              "There should also be a right to get a copy of personal data collected about us. It should be regulated by law that this information must be automatically sent, in a standardized format, to a personal data store, through which individuals could manage the use of their data."
            </p>
            <p>
              I could write a matching 20+ page response to this article, but suffice it to say that we are all very confused and worried about the future, but it's going to be extremely difficult to tame the beast that is Big Data. Much is to be learned about our transparent-as-ever yet increasingly opaque digital universe.
